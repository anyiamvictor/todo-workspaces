Todo Workspaces
Todo Workspaces is a task management web app built with React. It helps users manage their todos within different workspaces. It is useful for small teams or individuals who want to group tasks by project or category and collaborate efficiently.

Each workspace can contain multiple todo items.

Once marked as completed, a task becomes locked and cannot be edited unless unlocked.

Supervisors can review and either approve the task or unlock it for revisions.

Built using Vite for fast development and performance.
